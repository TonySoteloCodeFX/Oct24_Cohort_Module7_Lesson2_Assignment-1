                <h3>The Vibrant Tradition of Day of the Dead in Mexico </h3>

                <p>
                    The Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos) is one of Mexico's most iconic and meaningful traditions, celebrated annually from October 31 to November 2. Unlike somber mourning, this festival is a joyous reunion between the living and the dead. Rooted in indigenous practices and blended with Spanish Catholic influences, it honors the memories of loved ones who have passed away.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the heart of the celebration are **ofrendas**—altars adorned with photos, marigolds (cempasúchil), candles, and the deceased's favorite foods. Families gather to share stories, visit gravesites, and offer items to help their loved ones on their spiritual journey. Each day has its significance: November 1 is dedicated to children (Angelitos), while November 2 honors adults. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Food and decorations play a big role, from **pan de muerto** (a sweet bread) to sugar skulls, symbolizing both death and the sweetness of life. Vibrant parades, music, and face painting add to the lively atmosphere, celebrating life’s cycle and the enduring connection between families, both living and deceased.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This beautiful tradition reminds us that death is not an end but a continuation of love and memory.
